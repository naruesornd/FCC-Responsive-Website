      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages,
      but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is
      with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is
      used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web
      browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break
      onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and
      underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are
      seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the
      browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically
      readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that.
      Using CSS, you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser,
      presenting your markup using whatever design you like.

    <p>
      As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how
      documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language —
      HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across
      other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for
      changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to
      create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a
      layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It
      can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links
      in this paragraph for specific examples.

    <p>
      CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups
      of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of
      elements on your web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be
      shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule
      that would achieve the styling described above:
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
      p { color: red; }
      body { background-color: #eee; }
    </code>
  </pre>

    <pre>
    <code>
      p { color: red; }
      body { background-color: #eee; }
    </code>
  </pre>

    <pre>
    <code>
      p { color: red; }
      body { background-color: #eee; }
    </code>
  </pre>

    <pre>
    <code>
      p { color: red; }
      body { background-color: #eee; }
    </code>
  </pre>

    <pre>
    <code>
      p { color: red; }
      body { background-color: #eee; }
    </code>
  </pre>

    <ul>
      <li>
        In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector . This selects
        the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case, we are
        styling level one headings.
      </li>
      <li>We then have a set of curly braces { }.</li>
      <li>
        Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form
        of property and value pairs. We specify the property (color in the above
        example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property
        after the colon (red in this example).
      </li>
      <li>
        This example contains two declarations, one for color and the other for
        font-size. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are
        selecting in this case), then a value that we'd like to give the
        property.
      </li>
      <li>Hello Wolrd!</li>
    </ul>

      All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined
      in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published
      by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and
      define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.

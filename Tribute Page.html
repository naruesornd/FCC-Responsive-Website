    John Clayton Mayer is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Born and raised in Fairfield County, Connecticut, 
    Mayer attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, 
    but left and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. 
    Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. 
    After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. 
    After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest festival, he was signed to Aware Records, 
    and eventually to Columbia Records, which released his first extended play Inside Wants Out. His following two studio albums—Room for Squares (2001) 
    and Heavier Things (2003)—performed well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. 
    In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for his single "Your Body Is a Wonderland".
